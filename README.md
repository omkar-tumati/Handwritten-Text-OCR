# Handwritten-Text-OCR
This project aims to create a Handwritten Text OCR (Optical Character Recognition) System that allows users to write or draw text on a screen, and then uses OCR technology to convert the handwritten input into editable digital text.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly application that:

1. Provides a canvas for users to write or draw text.

2. Captures the handwritten input and processes it using OCR.

3. Converts the handwritten text into digital text and displays it to the user.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the drawing canvas and user interface).

**Backend**: Python (for OCR processing and server-side logic).

**OCR Libraries**: Tesseract, EasyOCR, or Google Vision API.

**Frameworks**: Flask (for backend API) or PyQt/Tkinter (for desktop applications).
